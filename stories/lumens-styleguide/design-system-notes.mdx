## SVG

When working with SVG files, it's important to note that Salesforce uses svg-sprite-loader which processes multiple SVG files into a map. This approach optimizes SVG usage by bundling them together.
To use a single SVG in your application:

1. Place your SVG file in the `src/assets/svg` directory
2. Change the file extension from `.svg` to `.svgx`
3. Import the SVG in your component with:

```jsx
import SvgSample from '@/assets/svg/svg-sample.svgx?lms'

// Usage
const SamplePanel = () => (
    <div>
        <SvgSample />
    </div>
);
```


The `?lms` query parameter is crucial as it's required by webpack to properly recognize and process the SVG file. Without this parameter, webpack won't correctly handle the SVG import.
